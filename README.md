# Fireworks-Stand-Checkout
An application, using a solution algorithm that employs loops, that keeps track of customers purchases. The application accepts the dollar value of each item purchased as input until finished. When purchases are complete, a sentinel value  of -1 is entered to indicate the process has finished. If the item purchased is $50.00 or more, a 10% discount on the  item purchased is applied. All purchases display with the original price and the discount price.
